  <h1 class="post-title">Stop Managing Backlogs, Start Managing Portfolios</h1>
  <div class="post-meta">Published on September 8, 2025</div>

  <p>Backlogs are familiar. They give a sense of order. Every request gets a ticket. Every ticket has a status. The board moves and it looks like progress. Many leaders feel comfort when the backlog is full and velocity charts inch upward. The problem is that backlogs can reward activity instead of results.</p>

  <p>I am not against user stories. I am against letting a pile of stories drive strategy. A backlog is a tool for execution. It is not a decision framework. When the backlog takes the lead, teams drift into shipping more and more without knowing if any of it matters. That is why I push organizations to adopt a portfolio view. It changes the conversation from tasks to outcomes and from speed to value.</p>

  <h2>How backlog first thinking goes sideways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Volume becomes the goal.</strong> Teams brag about tickets closed. Stakeholders ask for more capacity. No one pauses to ask what moved the business.</li>
    <li><strong>Pet projects sneak in.</strong> Without a clear link to objectives, influential voices push their requests to the top. It feels like progress until the quarter ends and the needle did not move.</li>
    <li><strong>Carryover is normal.</strong> Work slides from sprint to sprint. The list grows. Few items get requalified against outcomes. The backlog becomes a museum of old ideas.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What a portfolio mindset changes</h2>
  <p>A portfolio is a living map of where we will invest attention. It forces us to state the outcomes we want, to name the opportunities that could deliver them, and to choose the few that deserve real capacity. The backlog still matters, but it is now in service of the portfolio.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Outcome first.</strong> Start with objectives and key results. Then identify opportunities and the initiatives that express them.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparent tradeoffs.</strong> The board shows what we are doing and what we are not. Saying no gets easier when the reasons are visible.</li>
    <li><strong>Capacity truth.</strong> We decide based on what teams can actually do, not what we wish they could do.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to make the shift in a week</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Freeze new tickets for five days.</strong> Let emergencies through, but pause the intake of new work. Use the time to step back.</li>
    <li><strong>Create a one page portfolio view.</strong> List objectives, key results, and the three to five opportunities that matter most right now. Use short plain sentences.</li>
    <li><strong>Attach teams and time boxes.</strong> Name the owner team for each initiative. Set simple windows like two weeks for discovery or four weeks for delivery.</li>
    <li><strong>Rewrite the backlog for alignment.</strong> Move or close stories that do not support an active initiative. If something is truly important, it must link to an outcome.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Examples that make the difference clear</h2>
  <h3>Example 1. A growing backlog with slowing growth</h3>
  <p>Suppose signups have flattened. The backlog is full of small polish tasks. None of them will change the trend. The portfolio view proposes three opportunities. Reduce friction in the first five minutes. Improve the promise on the pricing page. Introduce a simple referral nudge.</p>
  <p>We score them, pick the first two, and give a team four weeks. The backlog now serves those initiatives. Do we still fix bugs. Yes. But the lion share of attention goes to work that can move a key result.</p>

  <h3>Example 2. Too many stakeholders and not enough clarity</h3>
  <p>In complex organizations, requests pour in from every corner. Support wants speed on one class of issues. Sales needs features for a big account. Product wants to test a new idea. Instead of mediating each request in isolation, we put them against the portfolio. Which requests advance current objectives. Which can be batched into a planned initiative. Which belong in a parking lot with a real review date.</p>

  <h2>Keep stories, but put them in their place</h2>
  <p>Stories are great for planning increments of work. They are poor at explaining why the work matters. Use stories to express a solution inside an active initiative. Tie them to the opportunity and the key result. Remove stories that do not have that link. People will feel the difference almost immediately.</p>

  <h2>Cadence is culture</h2>
  <p>The shift from backlog first to portfolio first sticks when you keep a steady rhythm. Run a short portfolio review every two weeks. Invite cross functional leaders. Review outcomes, the state of initiatives, and what to stop. Keep the tone calm and factual. Celebrate progress that moves a key result, not just output.</p>

  <h2>Bring the human side to the front</h2>
  <p>No system works without healthy teams. Track load and skills. If a team is carrying too much, move work or pause an initiative. If a key skill is missing, invest in it before you scale the bet. Leadership is not about pushing harder. It is about creating the conditions for meaningful work.</p>

  <h2>What you will notice within a month</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fewer in flight items.</strong> That alone raises throughput.</li>
    <li><strong>Better conversations.</strong> Stakeholders argue outcomes, not tickets.</li>
    <li><strong>More energy.</strong> Teams feel the purpose behind the plan and it shows.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Backlogs keep you organized. Portfolios keep you honest. When you let outcomes lead, the backlog becomes a tool for focus instead of a list to manage. That is when the work starts to matter again.</p>
