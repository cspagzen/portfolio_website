    <div class="testimonial-quote">
        "Working with Chris at Embroker was one of those rare experiences that totally changes how you think about leadership. He wasn't even my direct manager, he was two levels up, but he had this way of making that gap disappear. I always felt comfortable reaching out to him, and every conversation gave me more clarity, confidence, and the sense that my ideas actually mattered. You don't see that <span class="highlight">level of accessibility in an executive</span> very often, and it says a lot about the kind of culture he builds. What I admire most about Chris is how he <span class="highlight">creates an environment where people feel safe to experiment, share ideas, and grow</span>."
